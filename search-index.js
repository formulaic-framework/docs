Formulaic contains modules and components that Flyyn has built into many Nest and React applications, and have been abstracted into this namespace to be reusable. Utilities return strongly-typed, safe, and chainable responses (using FP) An Either-like structure strongly types error cases A Promise-like chaining structure to quickly transform data Returned data can be directly sent to clients (using fp-interceptor) Data Types (FP) Provides a strongly-typed and chainable structure for return values. Used by most Formulaic libraries. Entity Service Provides TypeORM based utilities that are useful in most Nest services that interact with a TypeORM Repository. Hashing Module Extremely basic wrapper around bcrypt to use as a Nest service. ID Generator Module Provides powerful shortcuts to generate random, collision resistent IDs in multiple formats. FP Interceptor Intercepts outgoing HTTP responses in Nest, allowing routes to safely return FP formatted objects. Authorization (ACL) Utilities Utilities to quickly create authorization schemes using CASL. Auth Module Provides both a simple authentication guard that implements the functionality of Nest’s authentication tutorial, as well as hooks for more complex ACL schemes. Works well with the ACL library. Requires requests to authenticate via JWT, provided as an Authorization header. We recommend using Formulaic in a Yarn (version 2+, \"Berry\") monolithic repository, with a standard Nest server and a React application created with Vite. Example repository initialization mkdir ~/Documents/my-app/ cd ~/Documents/my-app/ git init --initial-branch=main yarn init -w -2 cd packages/ # Create a Nest server - this example uses the Nest CLI to initialize # the package with a basic Nest boilerplate. npx @nestjs/cli new \"my-server\" cd my-server rm -rf .git yarn add @nestjs/swagger @nestjs/typeorm typeorm express yarn add --dev webpack # Create a React application using Vite cd ../ yarn create vite --template react-ts my-app Formulaic is composed of a number of independent packages, all available on NPM under the @formulaic namespace.

These implementations are organized into a basic hierarchy to help you narrow down which implementation is most suited for your use case. FP Inheritance Tree FP Data DataFP Literal BaseErrorFP ErrorFP UnexpectedError DatabaseException NoValue Empty MissingPermission NotFound AccessForbidden EntityNotFound There are two main interfaces commonly used for representing \"successful data\" - DataFP and Literal. Literal has been used extensively in the documentation so far, and is designed to be a very simple wrapper around values of any type. Basic example of Literal import { Literal } from \"@formulaic/fp\"; const input = new Literal(10); // => Literal expect(input.data).toBe(10); Literal allows you to create an FP object without defining any classes or potential for conflicting fields, however it means all data is a layer below inside the data property. DataFP is an abstract class that is ready for you to define your own FP object, representing a successful state. The next section will walk through extending DataFP in depth. By extending DataFP, details are available at the top level, and can also be included in OpenAPI documents. Example usage of custom class extending DataFP const response = new LoginResponse(\"admin\", \"[jwt contents]\"); (1) expect(response.id).toBe(\"admin\"); 1 LoginResponse extends DataFP, and is defined in the next section. FP contains a few ways to represent \"errors\"[1] or other failures. We mention UnexpectedError first, which may be the only error implementation you wish to use if you are concerned about revealing information in the case of failures. Interface of UnexpectedError class UnexpectedError extends ErrorFP { kind: \"UnexpectedError\"; status: 500; code?: string; error?: Err; serializedError?: string; } If you use fp-interceptor, UnexpectedError defaults to only returning kind and status in production environments, while also including code and error in development. This allows you to safely create instances and sub-classes of UnexpectedError without any risk of revealing error causes or information in production, which may reveal sensitive information. If you wish to create your own errors (that aren’t set to hide all properties by default), ErrorFP is made to be extended. ErrorFP extends Error with only one change - ErrorFP sets noValue to true, which prevents substitutions from running. This is very often the desired behavior, however in some cases may have something that \"failed\" yet still should be treated as a missing value. For these cases you can extend Error instead of ErrorFP, and the same instructions will hold. FP defines an explicit \"empty\" or \"missing value\" type, which both avoids the dangers of \"null\" and enables chaining and other utility functions. FP provides three ways to create \"no value\" responses. Earlier sections have already used the Empty class as a counterpart to Literal in order to create Either-like functionality. Empty is often used as-is to create a null-like \"valueless-value\", or can be extended. Along with the minimal Empty class, FP also includes built-in implementations like MissingPermission. NoValue can be directly extended for your own purposes. Frequently applications need to handle requests for entities that users do not have permission to view. While a permission denied request could be sent as a 401 Unauthorized response, it is often good practice to respond with a 404 Not Found response, completely obscuring all information about the entity including it’s existence. However, during development and debugging, there normally is no reason why developers should be restricted from seeing the root cause of an error. FP provides a built-in type to handle this specific case due to how often it comes up, even in other FP modules like our database utilities. NotFound is a base class like UnexpectedError, where all information is stripped by default in production. NotFound can be used directly, taking a description of the entity, and a flag permissionError which is set to true if an entity exists but the user can’t access it, and set to false if the entity does not exist. const notFound = new NotFound(\"User\", false); const notPermitted = new NotFound(\"User\", true); A shortcut, AccessForbidden exists for permission errors: const forbidden = new AccessForbidden(\"User\"); And implementations like EntityNotFound exist for failed operations, and may include additional information (like the failed query): import { Literal, EntityNotFound } from \"@formulaic/fp\"; import { Repository, FindOneOptions } from \"typeorm\"; async function findById( repo: Repository, id: string, ): Promise | EntityNotFound> { const query: FindOneOptions = { where: { id }, }; const found = await repo.findOne(query); if(!found) { return new EntityNotFound(\"User\", query); } return new Literal(found); } 1. FP does not assign any specific definition or severity when using the term \"error\", leaving it to the user. arrow_back Data (Either) Creating Custom Data Classes arrow_forward","title":"Common FP Instances","component":"fp","version":"1.0.0","name":"common","url":"/fp/1.0.0/common/","titles":[{"text":"Data","id":"data"},{"text":"Literal","id":"literal"},{"text":"DataFP","id":"data-fp"},{"text":"Errors","id":"error"},{"text":"UnexpectedError","id":"error-unexpected"},{"text":"ErrorFP","id":"error-fp"},{"text":"No Value","id":"no-value"},{"text":"Empty","id":"no-value-empty"},{"text":"Other built-in implementations","id":"no-value-built-in"},{"text":"Custom Implementation of NoValue","id":"no-value-custom"},{"text":"NotFound","id":"no-value-not-found"}]},"/fp/1.0.0/custom/":{"text":"You can use FP’s Literal class for successful data, but has many limitations. To go beyond the default Literal class, you can define a custom class that extends DataFP (an abstract class from FP). Example class created by extending DataFP import { ApiProperty } from \"@nestjs/swagger\"; import { Expose } from \"class-transformer\"; import { Equals, IsIn, IsJWT, IsString } from \"class-validator\"; import { DataFP } from \"./DataFP\"; export class LoginResponse extends DataFP { public static readonly kind = \"LoginResponse\"; (1) @ApiProperty() (2) @Equals(\"LoginResponse\") @Expose() public override readonly kind: \"LoginResponse\"; (3) @ApiProperty() @IsIn([200, 201]) @Expose() public override readonly status: 200 | 201; (3) @ApiProperty() @IsString() @Expose() public readonly id: string; (4) @ApiProperty() @IsJWT() @Expose() public readonly jwt: string; (4) public constructor( id: string, jwt: string, newRegistration: boolean = false, ) { super(); this.kind = \"LoginResponse\"; this.status = newRegistration ? 201 : 200; this.id = id; this.jwt = jwt; } } 1 Defining a static kind property is used in some utilities, but is not required. 2 DataFP does not attach ApiProperty, Expose, or any validation decorators (unlike other FP classes) - if using OpenAPI or fp-interceptor you should declare ApiProperty and Expose. 3 You must define kind and status fields. 4 You may define any additional fields to represent your data, such as id and jwt. Now the properties are exposed directly in the returned object, no need to go through data: Example usage of custom class extending DataFP const response = new LoginResponse(\"admin\", \"[jwt contents]\"); expect(response.id).toBe(\"admin\"); If an error might be returned, you can check that the value is a LoginResponse before accessing fields, or use a transformation like map or chain. async function performLogin( username: string, password: string, ): Promise> { return response; } const login = await performLogin(\"admin\", \"top-secret-password\"); if(login.hasData) { console.log(`Success! JWT: ${login.jwt}`); } else { console.log(\"Failed login.\"); } arrow_back Common FP Instances","title":"Creating Custom Data Classes","component":"fp","version":"1.0.0","name":"custom","url":"/fp/1.0.0/custom/","titles":[]},"/fp/1.0.0/data/":{"text":"The previous examples of chaining used two implementations of FP: Literal and Empty. These two classes provide an implementation of Either, seen in Haskell, and JavaScript libraries such as fp-ts, Folktale, and more. Implementations of Either provide a clear and unmistakable difference between the presence and absence of data - avoiding null, undefined, and other troublesome ways of representing a lack of data. Before getting too far, it may be best to look at the actual properties of Literal and Empty - the type system will save you from the properties on the backend, but it may be helpful to see how FP works, and how the objects look after the compiler strips out type information. The following definitions include properties defined in inherited classes to provide more information that exist in the actual class definitions of Literal and Empty. Properties of Literal class Literal extends Data { kind: \"Literal\"; status: 200 | 201; hasData: true; hasError: false; noValue: false; data: T; } Properties of Empty class Empty extends NoValue { kind: \"Empty\"; status: 404; hasData: false; hasError: false; noValue: true; } There are (at least) five different ways to evaluate and process values that are returned as Literal or Either instances, with reasons why each may be good for certain situations. We will be using the same data for all of the following examples, which is a basic example of loading a configuration value. Example Literal/Empty for use in following examples import { readFileSync } from \"fs\"; function loadPortConfig(filename: string = \"port.txt\"): Literal | Empty { try { const fileContent = readFileSync(filename, \"utf8\"); const num = parseInt(fileContent, 10); if(num && !isNaN(num)) { return new Literal(num); } return new Empty(); } catch (e) { return new Empty(); } } const portConfig = loadPortConfig(); Every FP object is required to include a kind field, which can determine if the returned config is a Literal. Example using kind var port: number; if(portConfig.kind === \"Literal\") { console.log(`Listening on port ${portConfig.data}, as-per config.`); port = portConfig.data; } else { console.log(\"No configured port. Defaulting to '80'.\"); port = 80; } While kind provides an exact match, every FP also contains three flags providing a more general description of an object: hasData, hasError, noValue. This is overkill when only Either or Literal could be returned, but you could use these flags to filter out errors and empty values: Example filtering by hasError, noValue if(portConfig.hasError) { console.log(\"Error loading port!\"); } else if(portConfig.noValue) { console.log(\"No port specified, will use default.\"); } else { console.log(`Port configured as ${portConfig.data}`); } All FP objects include a status code, intended to represent HTTP response status codes (or process exit codes). One could use these fields similar to the descriptor fields - e.g. responses with status in the range 300 - 500 are likely errors, and this could be compared similar to the last example using hasError - although we don’t see why anyone would prefer this. However, if you are writing general middleware that formats FP objects into HTTP responses, you may find status useful. The above examples used FP properties, but every FP object also includes utility methods. The first example used kind to set a default if Empty was found, however altValue() could avoid the entire if/else block. Example with altValue const port = portConfig.altValue(80); This method is least recommended, but in some environments, instanceof will work to determine the class hierarchy used to create the FP object. if(portConfig instanceof Literal) { console.log(\"Port was configured!\"); } else { console.log(\"No port configured, using defaults.\"); } arrow_back FP Interface Common FP Instances arrow_forward","title":"Data (Either)","component":"fp","version":"1.0.0","name":"data","url":"/fp/1.0.0/data/","titles":[{"text":"Properties","id":"properties"},{"text":"Using Literal/Empty Values","id":"usage"},{"text":"Checking 'kind'","id":"usage-kind"},{"text":"Using Description properties (hasData, etc.)","id":"usage-props"},{"text":"Using status","id":"usage-status"},{"text":"Utility Methods","id":"usage-util"},{"text":"Using instanceof","id":"usage-instanceof"}]},"/fp/1.0.0/fp/":{"text":"All FP types follow an interface defined in the library as an abstract class FP. All FP instances have a property kind, intended as an easily discriminated field to tell one type from another. If you extend an FP instance, you will need to include another property to discriminate between sub-types. This is used for UnexpectedError, which is intended to contain many different error types that developers might like to report as a generic \"500 Server Error\", without revealing details about where the error came from. The various implementations of UnexpectedError all use the kind \"UnexpectedError\", and use a code property to distinguish between implementations. kind is good to narrow instances down to a specific interface, but FP also includes 3 files to provide a general description of items, which also describes how the chaining methods will operate. Objects can be marked \"hasData\", intended to signify \"successful\" responses that include data, including data successfully fetched from the database, or a response for the user marking an operation as completed without errors. Objects can be marked as \"hasError\", intended to signify a \"failure\" is being reported. The final flag is noValue, marking an absence of data without a specific error - similar to the empty case of Maybe (a structure in many functional languages/libraries). This is especially useful for some chaining methods - FP supports two classes of \"fallback\", one that replaces any \"non-successful\" response with the provided value, and one that only replaces a lack of value, but doesn’t change errors. Like Promise methods .then and .catch, FP instances have a set of common methods that allow data to be quickly transformed, and operations to be applied only if data exists. Unlike Promises, Formulaic’s FP library generally does not try to call chaining methods on asynchronous values that have not been resolved yet. In the following example, .catch and .then may be called before the first value resolves. Promise Chaining const response = Promise.resolve(10); const fallback = response.catch(e => -1); const mapped = fallback.then(i => i * 2); However with FP, you should await asynchronous values before calling chaining methods: Awaiting FP values async function getData(): Promise | EntityNotFound> { return new Literal(10); } const value = await getData(); const mapped = await value.chain(async i => Promise.resolve(i + 1)); const second = await mapped.chain(async i => Promise.resolve(i * 2)); FP’s .chain works similar to Promise’s .then - it expects an asynchronous transformation to be provided, does not call the given function if in an error state, and can switch to an error state if the provided transformation produces an error. Performs Transformations const url = new Literal(\"http://example.com/\"); const fetched = await url.chain(async url => { return await fetch(url); }); Doesn’t run unless \"successful data\" const missingUrl = new Empty(); const fetchMissing = await missingUrl.chain(async url => { // This code will never run, because 'Empty' isn't \"successful data\" return new MissingPermission(); }); // => Empty (1) 1 Chaining methods are typed well enough that the transform will be completely ignored if TypeScript knows that there’s no way missingUrl could be a data type.

You can provide an FP instance, or a non-FP value that will be wrapped in Literal. const error = new UnexpectedFailure(); const safe = error.orValue(new Literal(10)); // => Literal const safeCallback = error.or(() => { return new Empty(); }); // => Empty const empty = new Empty(); const withDefault = empty.or(10); // => Literal alt functions similar to or, taking in a fallback value (or a function that returns the fallback value).

Formulaic’s ACL package comes with a basic set of actions that are suitable for many applications, and are used internally in some libraries. You may choose to use the built-in actions, supplement the actions, or ignore them and create your own enumeration of actions. Manage Create Browse Update Delete Remove Submit Typically applications use CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions to represent most operations - we’ve renamed read to browse to make all actions 6 letters long. We also supply both \"delete\" and \"remove\", intended for applications that use soft-deletion. delete is intended to be the user’s primary thought of deletion - soft-delete if the application supports it, otherwise hard deletion. remove is intended to always represent a hard-deletion, which may be an administrator-only action. We find that we’re often in a position where there’s one additional action to add to entities, that’s relatively obvious given what the entity represents. An article draft needs to be published/applied to go live A user-submission in a moderation queue gets approved by a moderator A shopping cart gets converted into an order An action that’s been drafted/dry-run is approved to be executed You may wish to create a unique action for each of these. Alternatively, Formulaic provides submit as a pre-defined action, to reduce the number of one-off actions you have to define. src/ability.ts import { Ability, AbilityClass } from \"@casl/ability\"; import { Action, CRUDAction } from \"@formulaic/acl\"; import { AclPost, AclUser, } from \"./subjects\"; export type Abilities = [Action.MANAGE, \"all\"] | [Action, \"AclPost\" | AclPost] | [CRUDAction, \"AclUser\" | AclUser]; export type AppAbility = Ability; export const AppAbility = Ability as AbilityClass; arrow_back Define ACL Subjects Defining Rules/Permissions arrow_forward","title":"Define Abilities","component":"acl","version":"1.0.1","name":"03-abilities","url":"/acl/1.0.1/package/03-abilities/","titles":[{"text":"Formulaic’s Actions","id":"_formulaics_actions"},{"text":"Built-in Actions","id":"_built_in_actions"},{"text":"CRUD","id":"_crud"},{"text":"Hard/Soft Delete","id":"_hardsoft_delete"},{"text":"Submit","id":"_submit"},{"text":"Defining Abilities using Built-in Actions","id":"_defining_abilities_using_built_in_actions"}]},"/acl/1.0.1/package/04-rules/":{"text":"CASL has you build your permission rules in the context of a specific user (or lack of, for unauthenticated requests). src/rules.ts import { AbilityBuilder } from \"@casl/ability\"; import { Action } from \"@formulaic/acl\"; import { AppAbility } from \"./ability\"; import { Role } from \"./role\"; import { AclUser } from \"./subjects\"; export function abilityFor(user?: AclUser) { const { can, cannot, build } = new AbilityBuilder(AppAbility); const roles = user?.roles ??

Integration with an authorization library (like CASL) provides a much better flow. The following suggestions will use CASL for authorization, Formulaic’s FP module to format responses, and integrate with Nest’s OpenAPI module to document the API (and allow for automatic API client generation). However, you may choose a different set of tools that are more appropriate for your development. The following controller was started in the documentation for Formulaic’s FPInterceptor. src/user/user.controller.ts import { Ability } from \"@formulaic/acl\"; import { DatabaseException, oneOfFP } from \"@formulaic/fp\"; import { Acl } from \"@formulaic/auth-module\"; import { AccessForbidden, MissingPermission } from \"@formulaic/fp\"; import { Controller, Param } from \"@nestjs/common\"; import { ApiExtraModels, ApiTags, ApiOkResponse } from \"@nestjs/swagger\"; import { AppAbility, Role } from \"acl\"; (1) import { UserService } from \"./user.service\"; import { UserDetails } from \"./dto/user-response\"; @Controller(\"user\") @ApiTags(\"users\") @ApiExtraModels( MissingPermission, NotFound, UserDetails, DatabaseException ) export class UserController { public constructor( private readonly users: UserService, ) {} @Get(\":userId\") @ApiOkResponse(oneOfFP([ MissingPermission, NotFound, UserDetails, DatabaseException, ])) public async userDetails( @Acl() ability: AppAbility, @Param(\"userId\") userId: string, ): Promise | DatabaseException | UserDetails> { if(ability.cannot(Action.BROWSE, \"AclUser\")) { return new MissingPermission(); (2) } const found = await this.users.findById(userId); const permitted = await found.mapDataAsync(async user => { const userAcl: UserAcl = { kind: \"UserAcl\", id: user.id, roles: user.isAdmin ?

If you are using CASL or another more powerful authorization flow, you may wish to skip this section and go directly to more advanced usage. Users can be required to have (any) valid authentication provided to access a route. Annotate with @Private(), or if you set defaultPolicy: \"deny\", mark routes that do not require authentication with @Public(). Use @RequireRoles() to require users to have all of the roles listed. Alternatively, use RequireOneOfRole to offer a list of roles that users must have one or more of to access the route. You can use parameter decorators to fetch various details parsed from authentication. By default, all parameter decorators return undefined if the user wasn’t authenticated - either annotate with @Private(), or provide an argument true to the decorator. The decorator will throw an error if it was unable to fetch the value in required mode. Use @CurrentUserId() to get the ID of the current user. @Controller(\"test\") export class TestController { @Public() @Get(\"id\") public async currentUser( @CurrentUserId() id: string | undefined, ) {} @Private() @Get(\"id/safe\") public async requireCurrentUser( @CurrentUserId(true) id: string, ) {} } arrow_back Importing the Auth Module Advanced Authorization Usage arrow_forward","title":"Basic Authentication Usage","component":"auth-module","version":"0.2.2","name":"basic","url":"/auth-module/0.2.2/basic/","titles":[{"text":"Guard Configuration","id":"_guard_configuration"},{"text":"Require Authentication","id":"_require_authentication"},{"text":"Require Roles","id":"_require_roles"},{"text":"Parameters","id":"_parameters"},{"text":"Current ID","id":"_current_id"}]},"/auth-module/0.2.2/importing/":{"text":"You should add the AuthModule in your AppModule to enable it globally.
